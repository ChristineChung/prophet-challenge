module 8 challenge

My study group and I worked together during multiple sessions between Wednesday and the weekend to complete this homework assignment. There were about five of us working through the solutions together. We worked together on the entire assignment. We went step by step through each problem and referenced the teachers notes from class to talk through the code solutions. We took turns sharing code ideas to solve the questions and troubleshooted errors together. We used any info anyone learned from the TA's and BCS tutors and shared it with the group to work through all the solutions.
